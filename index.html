            <h6>Black Mirror is a British anthology television series</h6>
            <p>created by Charlie Brooker. Individual episodes explore a diversity of genres, but most are set in
                near-future dystopias with science fiction technology—a type of speculative fiction. The series is based
                on The Twilight Zone and uses technology to comment on contemporary social issues. Most episodes are
                written by Brooker, with heavy involvement by the executive producer Annabel Jones. </p>
